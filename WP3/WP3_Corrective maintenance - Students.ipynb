{"cells":[{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["# Description of this work package\n","\n","Let us assume that you are the operator of a factory, where bearings are critical components in your machine. The failure of bearings is catastrophic for the machine so the failure cost of the bearing is estimated to be $C_1 = 100 000$ euros. The price of a bearing is $1000$ euros. From the vendor, you obtained a result of life testing of the bearings conducted by the vendor (see the attached excel file). The unit of the lifetime is already transformed into days. Please note that the testing is censored after 600 days. You goal is to decide a best maintenance strategy for the bearings. You are considering three options:\n","- Implement a corrective maintenance strategy: Replace the bearing only when the bearing fails.\n","- Purchase a online condition-monitoring system from Siemens: The sensor will monitor the state of the bearing and issue a warning when the failure is about to occur. So that you have an opportunity to replace the bearing just before the failure is going to happen.\n","- Implement a preventive maintenance strategy: Replace the bearing preventively based on a pre-defined time/age.\n","\n","In this project, you are going to help the operator to choose the best maintenance plan by doing some analyses."]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["# Task 1: Estimate the expected cost rate of a corrective maintenance strategy.\n","\n","The purpose of this task is to calculat the expected cost rate of a corrective maintenance strategy. Expected cost rate $C(t)$ is defined as:\n","$$ EC(t) = E \\lim_{t\\rightarrow \\infty} \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{N(t)} C_i}{t}$$\n","where $N(t)$ is the number of failures before $t$ and $C_i$ is the cost per failure.\n","\n","To solve this problem, first we need to fit the life testing data of the bearing and determine a best lifetime distribution. Hint: You can get some help from this notebook: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1a0xxZ6eDUjpmoHS4URgeFr-D01qqZ7R5?usp=sharing. Then, according to renewal process theory, $E C(t)$ can be calculated by (see lecture slide for details) $E C(T) = \\frac{C_i}{MTTF}.$"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"vscode":{"languageId":"plaintext"}},"outputs":[],"source":[]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["# Task 2: Estimate the expected cost rate if we implement the Siemens model.\n","\n","In the model you developed for Siemens, when the algorithm predicts a label \"1\", it actually indicates an inbalanced in the rotation of the bearing. The bearing does not fail yet, but it is an indication that a failure is going to happen soon. It is fair to assume that if we replace the bearing when the model predicts \"1\", we only need to pay the cost of the bearing itself, not the failure cost $C_1$. However, since your model is not perfect, it might have \"false alarm\" and \"missing alarm\". When a false alarm happens, you will replace a healthy bearing with $C_2 = 1000$ euros; while when a missing alarm happens, you will pay cost $C_1$ as your model did not detect the failure. If a failure happens and it is detected by your model, then the cost will be $C_2$ as well. The goal for this task is, then, to estimate the expected cost rate if we implement this \"imperfect model\", so that we could compare it to the other maintenance strategies.\n","\n","Hints: \n","- You can use the results of your cross validation to estimate the false alarm and missing alarm probability.\n","- To calculate expected cost rate for a complex system, we could use Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the average cost rate over $t$, and let $t$ increases until this value converges."]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3.8.6 64-bit","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.8.6"},"orig_nbformat":4,"vscode":{"interpreter":{"hash":"1e4347efc9525cc332960ef81a08601dc32726a1c4f3143eac4c61d078948a8b"}}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":2}
