{"cells":[{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["# Description of this work package\n","\n","Let us assume that you are the operator of a factory, where bearings are critical components in your machine. The failure of bearings is catastrophic for the machine so the failure cost of the bearing is estimated to be $C_1 = 100 000$ euros. The price of a bearing is $1000$ euros. From the vendor, you obtained a result of life testing of the bearings conducted by the vendor (see the attached excel file). The unit of the lifetime is already transformed into days. Please note that the testing is censored after 600 days. You goal is to decide a best maintenance strategy for the bearings. You are considering three options:\n","- Implement a corrective maintenance strategy: Replace the bearing only when the bearing fails.\n","- Purchase a online condition-monitoring system from Siemens: The sensor will monitor the state of the bearing and issue a warning when the failure is about to occur. So that you have an opportunity to replace the bearing just before the failure is going to happen.\n","- Implement a preventive maintenance strategy: Replace the bearing preventively based on a pre-defined time/age.\n","\n","In WP3, we have compared the first two scenarios. The purpose of this work package is, then, to determine the best preventive maintenance strategy. Then, you will need to decide what is the best maintenance strategy the factory needs to choose."]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["# Task 1: Optimize the age replacement plan.\n","\n","First, let us consider an age replacement plan. Your task here is to determine the best replacement age if we choose an age replacement strategy and calculate the corresponding expected cost rate.
